Putting on a drum show
(Ooh)
Completed checklist for today
Now they have to
let you out of your cage
Feeling stuck between a rock
and a home
Two places you do not
want to go, so, so
He's putting on a drum show
Even now, even now, even now
He'll take the longer way home
Even now, even now, even now
He'll never, ever say so
He drives fast
just to feel it, feel it
He drives slow
if his song's not over
Drown it out, drown it out
Show
(Ooh)
He'd rather feel something
than nothing at all
So he swerves all around
as his head starts to fall
Turns it up
Stuck between a rockand a home
Two places he does not
want to go, so, so
He's putting on a drum show
Even now, even now, even now
He'll take the longer way home
Even now, even now, even now
He'll never, ever say so
He drives fast
just to feel it, feel it
He drives slow
if his song's not over
Drown it out, drown it out
I've been this way
I want to change
I've been this way
I want to change!
